The losses in each of the .png graphs in this directory were tracked after a certain number of iterations or epochs (Iterations/Epochs) of the original model that was trained
on 800 images for 150 epochs. The csv of the losses is attached, with each column from left to right being the loss for Discriminator A (D_A_Loss), Generator A (G_A_Loss),
Cycle Loss A (Cycle_A_Loss), Identity Loss A (Identity_A_Loss),  Discriminator B (D_B_Loss), Generator B (G_B_Loss), Cycle Loss B (Cycle_B_Loss), and
Identity Loss B (Identity_B_Loss). the plot_loss.py was used to obtain these plots.
