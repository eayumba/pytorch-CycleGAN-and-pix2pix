Many thanks to Jun-Yan Zhu et-al for their initial CycleGAN implementation:

Unpaired Image-to-Image Translation using Cycle-Consistent Adversarial Networks.
Jun-Yan Zhu*, Taesung Park*, Phillip Isola, Alexei A. Efros. In ICCV 2017. (* equal contributions)
Image-to-Image Translation with Conditional Adversarial Networks.
Phillip Isola, Jun-Yan Zhu, Tinghui Zhou, Alexei A. Efros. In CVPR 2017.

All of our generated result spectrograms for different model implementations, training set sizes, testing methods, etc, can be found at: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1-JlTDUk24ifoJhfVpA17CxUm2LLDmo9U?usp=sharing

In this root folder, you will also find the .ipynb file for the logistic classifier. Everything else has to do with the CycleGAN. You can follow this by accessing Our_CycleGAN.ipynb.
